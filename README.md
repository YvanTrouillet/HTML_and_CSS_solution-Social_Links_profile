## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project presents no significant challenges, as it primarily involves basic HTML and CSS implementation. It serves as a beneficial exercise in practical application of these fundamental web technologies

As my current focus has been predominantly on backend development, this opportunity to revisit and work with HTML and CSS has been particularly valuable. The brief yet focused engagement with these frontend technologies provides a welcome change of pace and helps maintain a well-rounded skill set.

### Benefits of Regular HTML/CSS Practice

- Skill retention: Regularly revisiting HTML and CSS helps prevent skill degradation1.
- Balanced skillset: Maintaining frontend skills complements your backend expertise, making you a more well-rounded developer4.
- Improved problem-solving: Frontend challenges can enhance your overall coding abilities2.
